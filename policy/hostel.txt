Hostel maintenance complaints include electrical, water supply,
sanitation, and furniture issues.

Electrical and water-related complaints are forwarded to the
hostel maintenance section.

Normal resolution time is 24–48 working hours.

Emergency issues such as electric short-circuit or water leakage
must be escalated immediately to the hostel warden office.

The helpdesk can only register complaints and provide status.
Final resolution is handled by the hostel administration.
